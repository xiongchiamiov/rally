This game idea combines:

 * the horror and mystery part of [Betrayal]
 * the cooperation of [Left 4 Dead]
 * the first-person adventure-scavaging of [Penumbra]

To prevent it from being too fast-paced, while still first-person, a
freshly-opened door will open to a fog that dissipates when you enter the room.
Entering the room will also close the door behind you, preventing you from
escaping until you've dealt with whatever random event happens there.

Communication levels between the players will be set as a game option, ranging
from full text and voice chat with a minimap to no map and chat being softer (or
less contrast-y for text) as players get farther away. The attempt here is to
provide the opportunity for multiplayer without removing the scary atmosphere.

Weapons and ammo are scarce, and are simply what would be found in a house.
Think candlestick rather than SMG.

Likely going to be implemented in Scala, as that's the next language I'm working
on, and I need a project for it. Also, it's supposed to handle concurrency well
and has OpenGL bindings.

The name is unrelated, and comes from the attractive [Rally Vincent], as I have
been reading the excellent Gunsmith Cats manga recently.
